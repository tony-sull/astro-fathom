# Fathom Analytics for Astro

Use this package to add [Fathom's](https://usefathom.com) tracking script to your Astro site.

Astro Fathom exposes all the [advanced tracking options](https://usefathom.com/support/tracking-advanced) as component properties **and** stubs in a console logger when analytics are disabled for easy debugging.

## Fathom Analytics

> Fathom is a simple, light-weight, privacy-first alternative to Google Analytics. So, stop scrolling through pages of reports and collecting gobs of personal data about your visitors, both of which you probably donâ€™t need. Our website stats show up on a single, blazingly fast dashboard so you can make business decisions quickly.

From the [Fathom website](https://usefathom.com/).

## Installation

`npm install astro-fathom`

or

`pnpm install astro-fathom`

or if you really have to,

`yarn add astro-fathom`

## Usage

This package includes a `<Fathom>` component that can be used right in your layout's `<head>`.

```astro
---
import { Fathom } from "astro-fathom"
---

<html>
  <head>
    <!-- head stuff -->
    <Fathom site="<your fathom site id>" />
  </head>
</html>
```

Just looking for a basic script installation? That's it, you're all set!

The Fathom script will be included in all production builds. When running with `astro dev`, `window.fathom` will be shimmed with a logger that outputs all tracking events to the browser's console instead.

### Environment variables

It's common to keep analytics events separate for different deployment environments - for example `test`, `staging`, and `production`. We recommend using the environment variables listed below to configure the correct `site`, keeping your analytics configuration in the same place as your other environment configuration variables.

### Available options

See the Fathom docs for more information on these [advanced tracking options](https://usefathom.com/support/tracking-advanced).
